The same measurements and assumptions were made for this study where were made for the hospital focused ranking. This study, however, was focused at a state level aggregation. While the aggregate and mean score look similar to before, the variance is much higher. This is due to the wider scope which includes measurements of different hospitals in a fairly wide geographical area. Even if the group contained two high quality hospitals with different specializations, this would produce a high variance outcome.
