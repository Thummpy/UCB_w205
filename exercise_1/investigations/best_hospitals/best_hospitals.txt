For this study I selected 8 measurements which I thought best indicated quality of care. These measurements were:

Discharge instructions
Healthcare workers given influenza vaccination
Immunization for influenza
(inverse) Percent of newborns whose deliveries were scheduled early (1-3 weeks early), when a scheduled delivery was not medically necessary
Prophylactic Antibiotic Initiated Within One Hour Prior to Surgical Incision
Prophylactic antibiotic received within 1 hour prior to surgical incision
Prophylactic Antibiotic Selection for Surgical Patients
Prophylactic antibiotics discontinued within 24 hours after surgery end time

The aggregate score penalizes non-participation in one or more of these measurements, and takes an aggregated average. The Mean score weights the measurements by frequency, providing some advantage for specializing in an area. This is appropriate as one might go to a particular hospital because it does well in an area you need. I believe this will correlate better with user satisfaction later. Note that "Percent of newborns whose deliveries were scheduled early (1-3 weeks early), when a scheduled delivery was not medically necessary" is actually a negative indicator, and as such I took the negative measure (100-%) into account for scoring.
